This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

In this notebook, which is included in the "quizify" package we have some examples of quiz questions that can be "compiled" using 'quizify()'.

The format for the questions is free-form. But the answers must be written between the double-braces in the format shown below.

Typing 'help(quizify)' in the R-console will provide more information.
