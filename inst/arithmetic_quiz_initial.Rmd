This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

In this notebook, which is included in the "quizify" package we have some examples of quiz questions that can be "compiled" using 'quizify()'.

The format for the questions is free-form. But the answers must be written between the double-braces in the format shown below.

Typing 'help(quizify)' in the R-console will provide more information.


```{r}
tot = 0
```

Q1.1 What is 2 + 2?

A. 4
B. 3

{{
qnumber = 1.1
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
correct.answer = "A"
hint = "Try '2+2' from R console"
explanation = "Hard to explain"
}}


Q1.2 What is $e^{\pi i}$

A. 0
B. -1
C. Hard to say.
D. I don't know
{{
qnumber = 1.2
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
correct = "B"
hint = "Try 'Re(exp(pi * 1i))' from R console"
explanation = "exp(pi * i) = cos(pi) + i * sin(pi)."
}}

A non-multiple choice example [note: this doesn't work with current implementation of quiz.check(), which is limited to multiple choice.]

```{r}
x = runif(10)
```

Q1.3 What is the third element in 'x'?
{{
qnumber = 1.3
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
correct = x[3]
hint = "Answer with an R expression, e.g., x[3]. This doesn't work yet because yet because quiz.check() is limited to multiple choice."
explanation = "This doesn't work yet because yet because quiz.check() is limited to multiple choice."
}}
